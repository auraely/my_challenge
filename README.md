# my_challenge

##Description

This project was created for a marketing agency website.  The goal is to meet accesibility standards and also to make sure it's optimised for search engines. In order to solve this, we reorganise the semantic and structure of Html code, we make changes in the Css file, we rename some element tags and some classes and we add some specific atributes. 
The end result should be a website more accesible for reader and a code easier to understand by other developers.
